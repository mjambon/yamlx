(** Comment attachment pass.

    After the Composer has built a node tree (with all comment fields empty),
    this module takes the raw comment list collected by the Scanner and attaches
    each comment to the most appropriate node.

    Best-effort semantics ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Comment attachment is a
    heuristic process and cannot be perfect in all cases. The rules applied are:

    - {b Head comments}: standalone comment lines (lines that contain nothing
      but a comment) that appear immediately before a node are attached as
      [head_comments] of that node.

    - {b Line comments}: a comment on the same line as a node's start position
      is attached as [line_comment]. For mapping pairs where key and value start
      on the same line, the line comment is attached to the value (the last node
      on that line), not the key.

    - {b Foot comments}: standalone comment lines that appear after the last
      child of a collection, before the next sibling, are attached as
      [foot_comments] of the collection.

    Comments inside flow collections are not recorded by the Scanner. Comments
    that cannot be attributed to any node are silently discarded. The behavior
    is subject to change as the heuristics are refined. *)
